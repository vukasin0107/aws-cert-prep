## EC2 Instances

1. EC2 Instances Purchasing Options
- On-Demand Instances – short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
- Reserved (1 & 3 years)
- Reserved Instances – long workloads
- Convertible Reserved Instances – long workloads with flexible instances
- Savings Plans (1 & 3 years) –commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
- Spot Instances – short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
- Dedicated Hosts – book an entire physical server, control instance placement
- Dedicated Instances – no other customers will share your hardware
- Capacity Reservations – reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

2. EC2 On Demand
- Pay for what you use:
- Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
- All other operating systems - billing per hour
- Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
- No long-term commitment
- Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave

3. EC2 Reserved Instances
- Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
- You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)
- Reservation Period – 1 year (+discount) or 3 years (+++discount)
- Payment Options – No Upfront (+), Partial Upfront (++), All Upfront (+++)
- Reserved Instance’s Scope – Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ)
- Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database)
- You can buy and sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace

- Convertible Reserved Instance
    - Can change the EC2 instance type, instance family, OS, scope and tenancy
    - Up to 66% discount

4. EC2 Savings Plans
- Get a discount based on long-term usage (up to 72% - same as RIs)
- Commit to a certain type of usage ($10/hour for 1 or 3 years)
- Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans is billed at the On-Demand price

- Locked to a specific instance family & AWS region (e.g., M5 in us-east-1)
- Flexible across:
    - Instance Size (e.g., m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge)
    - OS (e.g., Linux, Windows)
    - Tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default)

5. EC2 Spot Instances
Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
- Instances that you can “lose” at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
- The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS

- Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure:
    - Batch jobs
    - Data analysis
    - Image processing
    - Any distributed workloads
    - Workloads with a flexible start and end time
- Not suitable for critical jobs or databases

6. EC2 Dedicated Hosts
A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
- Allows you address compliance requirements and use your existing server- bound software licenses (per-socket, per-core, pe—VM software licenses)
- Purchasing Options:
- On-demand – pay per second for active Dedicated Host
- Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)
- The most expensive option
- Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL – Bring Your Own License)
- Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs

7. EC2 Dedicated Instances 
- Instances run on hardware that’s dedicated to you
- May share hardware with other instances in same account
- No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop / Start)

8. EC2 Spot Instance Requests
- Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
- Define max spot price and get the instance while current spot price < max
- The hourly spot price varies based on offer and capacity
- If the current spot price > your max price you can choose to stop or terminate your instance with a 2 minutes grace period.
- Other strategy: Spot Block
- “block” spot instance during a specified time frame (1 to 6 hours) without interruptions
- In rare situations, the instance may be reclaimed
- Used for batch jobs, data analysis, or workloads that are resilient to failures.
- Not great for critical jobs or databases
- Terminating Spot Instance:
    - You can only cancel Spot Instance requests that are open, active, or disabled.
    - Cancelling a Spot Request does not terminate instances
    - You must first cancel a Spot Request, and then terminate the associated Spot Instances

9. Spot Fleets
- Spot Fleets = set of Spot Instances + (optional) On-Demand Instances
- The Spot Fleet will try to meet the target capacity with price constraints
- Define possible launch pools: instance type (m5.large), OS, Availability Zone
- Can have multiple launch pools, so that the fleet can choose
- Spot Fleet stops launching instances when reaching capacity or max cost
- Strategies to allocate Spot Instances:
- lowestPrice: from the pool with the lowest price (cost optimization, short workload)
- diversified: distributed across all pools (great for availability, long workloads)
- capacityOptimized: pool with the optimal capacity for the number of instances
- priceCapacityOptimized (recommended): pools with highest capacity available, then select
the pool with the lowest price (best choice for most workloads)
- Spot Fleets allow us to automatically request Spot Instances with the lowest price

10. Placement Groups
- Sometimes you want control over the EC2 Instance placement strategy
- That strategy can be defined using placement groups
- When you create a placement group, you specify one of the following strategies for the group:
    - **Cluster** — clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone(In the same rack
        - Pros: Great network (10 Gbps bandwidth between instances with Enhanced Networking enabled - recommended)
        - Cons: If the rack fails, all instances fails at the same time
        - Use case:
        - Big Data job that needs to complete fast
        - Application that needs extremely low latency and high network throughput)
    - **Spread** — spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ)
        - Pros:
            - Can span across Availability Zones (AZ)
            - Reduced risk is simultaneous failure
            - EC2 Instances are on different physical hardware
        - Cons:
            - Limited to 7 instances per AZ per placement group
        - Use case:
            - Application that needs to maximize high availability
            - Critical Applications where each instance must be isolated from failure from each other
    - **Partition—spreads** instances across many different partitions (which rely on different sets of racks) within an AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka)
        - Up to 7 partitions per AZ
        - Can span across multiple AZs in the same region
        - Up to 100s of EC2 instances
        - The instances in a partition do not share racks with the instances in the other partitions
        - A partition failure can affect many EC2 but won’t affect other partitions
        - EC2 instances get access to the partition information as metadata
        - Use cases: HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka

11. Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)
- https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-elastic-network-interfaces-in-the-virtual-private-cloud/
- Logical component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card
- The ENI can have the following attributes:
- Primary private IPv4, one or more secondary IPv4
- One Elastic IP (IPv4) per private IPv4
- One Public IPv4
- One or more security groups
- A MAC address
- You can create ENI independently and attach them on the fly (move them) on EC2 instances for failover
- Bound to a specific availability zone (AZ)

12. EC2 Hibernate
- Introducing EC2 Hibernate:
- The in-memory (RAM) state is preserved
- The instance boot is much faster! (the OS is not stopped / restarted)
- Under the hood: the RAM state is written to a file in the root EBS volume
- The root EBS volume must be encrypted
- Use cases:
    - Long-running processing
    - Saving the RAM state
    - Services that take time to initialize

Good to know:
- Supported Instance Families – C3, C4, C5, I3, M3, M4, R3, R4, T2, T3, …
- Instance RAM Size – must be less than 150 GB.
- Instance Size – not supported for bare metal instances.
- AMI – Amazon Linux 2, Linux AMI, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS & Windows…
- Root Volume – must be EBS, encrypted, not instance store, and large
- Available for On-Demand, Reserved and Spot Instances
- An instance can NOT be hibernated more than 60 days
